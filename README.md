This project explores cardiovascular risk prediction using classification algorithms like SVM and Naive Bayes. It performs exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and model evaluation using metrics like accuracy score. The dataset includes patient information such as blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and lifestyle habits.

Objectives; Load and clean real-world cardiovascular data -- Explore correlations and visualize distributions -- Train and compare classification models -- Evaluate predictions using accuracy metrics -- Predict risk for new patient inputs

Tools & Libraries; Python 3 -- pandas, numpy – data manipulation -- matplotlib, seaborn – data visualization -- scikit-learn – ML models (SVM, GaussianNB, DecisionTree, RandomForest) and metrics -- Jupyter Notebook

Files; Cardio.ipynb – Main notebook with EDA, model training, evaluation, and prediction -- cardio...csv – Dataset used in the project

How to Run; Clone this repository -- Install required dependencies -- Launch the notebook -- Follow through the steps to explore the data, train models, and make predictions

Model Results & Model	Accuracy (%); SVM	~49.1 -- Naive Bayes	~56.6
